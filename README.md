## Skateboard

### Description
>Create a skateboard in Onshape with a deck, trunks, hanger, brushings. and wheels. Then assemble the parts you made in the assembly tab and use nuts and bolts to secure the parts of the skateboard together. We also had to assign a different material to our different skateboard parts to get a realistic weight for our skateboard.

### Parts

#### Deck

>The deck was constructed using a rectangle and two circles at each end. Rather that just use extrude to create the holes in the deck to attach the trunk we used a new tool called hole. This allowed us to create countersunk holes for our bolts to fit into. Another thingt I learned is that you can add filites to whole faces which save a lot of time compared to to clicking on each indavidual edge. The deck was simple but still introduced some cool new tools. 

#### Trunks

>While creating the trunks there was a part I setched on a face of a previous part rather than the top plane like I was soposed to. This caused me quite a bit of trouble so I need to make sure in future projects I pay more attention to the instruction videos. The trunks were a really fun part to model and adding filets are really fun to do. 

#### Wheels and Bearings

>For the wheels and bearings we revolved a sketch. While creating the sketch it is important to remember that when you set the diameter of your wheel corectlyand not accedentaly make your diameter length into your radius length. i have had some experience with revolving stetches but this is something I need to remeber so my wheel does not end up to small or to large.

>When creating the final assembly we used bolts and nuts to attatch all the parts of my skateboard. At first I would put each nut and bolt in manually. Then I learned the replicate tool which made inseting these parts much simpler. I will be sure tgo use the tool in future assemblies. I enjoyed seeing the final project coming together and seeing my final skatboard.
